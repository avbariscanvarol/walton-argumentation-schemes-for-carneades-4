# Walton Argumentation Schemes for Carneades 4

This repo contains full lists of **Walton's Argumentation Schemes** in YAML for the use for the [**Carneades Argumentation System** (version 4)](https://github.com/carneades/carneades-4).

25 of the **Walton's argumentation schemes** are already available in YAML at **Carneades 4** as [walton.yml](https://github.com/carneades/carneades-4/blob/master/examples/AGs/YAML/walton.yml). However, in [**Argumentation Schemes (2008)**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/argumentation-schemes/9AE7E4E6ABDE690565442B2BD516A8B6), there are a total of **106 argumentation schemes**. We aimed to complete the list and created the remaining 81 argumentation schemes in YAML.

In addition to the our main file [walton.yml](https://github.com/basakkurtuldu/walton-argumentation-schemes-for-carneades-4/blob/master/walton.yml) in which a complete list is presented, there are also smaller files which are classified based on the classification system present in [**Argumentation Schemes (2008)**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/argumentation-schemes/9AE7E4E6ABDE690565442B2BD516A8B6). First, all the schemes are divided into 3 main categories ([**Reasoning**](https://github.com/basakkurtuldu/walton-argumentation-schemes-for-carneades-4/tree/master/A_reasoning), [**Source-based Arguments**](https://github.com/basakkurtuldu/walton-argumentation-schemes-for-carneades-4/tree/master/B_source-based-arguments), [**Applying Rues to Cases**](https://github.com/basakkurtuldu/walton-argumentation-schemes-for-carneades-4/tree/master/C_applying-rules-to-cases)), and under those categories, different files are created corresponding to different types of arguments falling into each category. 

This study was conducted within the scope of the master's thesis titled **Douglas Walton's Argumentation Schemes and Applications** prepared by [**Ba≈üak Kurtuldu**](https://github.com/basakkurtuldu) under the supervision of [**Dr. Vedat Kamer**](https://istanbul.academia.edu/VedatKamer), in the [**Department of Philosophy**](http://felsefe.edebiyat.istanbul.edu.tr), [**Istanbul University**](https://www.istanbul.edu.tr).

#### Updates
##### 2019-10-08

According to our correspondence with **Dr. Douglas Walton** on September 19, 2019, in which he informed us about the changes he made on some of the argumentation schemes which were presented in [**Argumentation Schemes (2008)**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/argumentation-schemes/9AE7E4E6ABDE690565442B2BD516A8B6) , we implemented these changes in our file:

* _Argument From Precedent_ was changed to _Argument From Exception To A Rule_.
* Spelling error was corrected in _Abductive Argumentation Scheme_.
* Spelling error was corrected in _Argument From Evidence to Hypothesis_.

We wish to thank **Dr. Douglas Walton** for his comments and corrections on _Carneades YAML (CYML)_ files at this repository.
